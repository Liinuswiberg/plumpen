# Plumpen reincarnated in Rust
Serenity with the Poise framework. Using shuttle for deployment.

No checks made for Discord API spam, as Shuttle (Free tier, extreme AWS markup spotted.) is so slow, that I wont exceed 10k faulty API calls per 10 minutes.
Or maybe its just my Rust code that is so bad, who knows?
